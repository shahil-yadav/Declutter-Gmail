# Declutter Gmail

## TL;DR

So basically, Declutter Gmail is this app I made to clean up my inbox. It uses Go (Golang) for the backend because its super fast and Angular for the front part. The coolest thing is it has this job queue inside so it can delete like thousands of emails without crashing everything. It makes my life way easier and I learned a lot making it.

## Making this for myself

Okay so honestly, I made this because deleting emails is boring. My inbox was full of spam and newsletters I dont even read anymore. I wanted a way to just say "delete everything from this sender" and boom, its gone.
